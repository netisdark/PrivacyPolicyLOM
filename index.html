      <h2>IP Logging and Your Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        IP addresses are logged to help us:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Secure our platform from unauthorized access or fraud.</li>
        <li>Debug and resolve technical issues effectively.</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations, if necessary.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, if a site server detects that the site owner is extracting or logging IP addresses without valid reasons, the following risks may arise:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The site owner may lose trust from clients due to privacy concerns.</li>
        <li>There is a chance that the SSL certificate or site certificate might be compromised or deemed invalid due to a breach of terms.</li>
      </ul>
